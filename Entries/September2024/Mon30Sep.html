        "Why do I need to be early to wash dishes? No dirty dishes come in until about 30 minutes after opening." <br>
        "Maybe it's about principle. The van with the ingredients arrives hours before the chefs get here." <br>
        "That's not the same. It's important to know that the shop will have everything it needs." <br>
        "It doesn't need clean dishes?" <br>
        "Not right away." <br>  
        The kitchen was layed out like a cross. Except one of its prongs had been cut and a foggy window layed across, creating a really long wall between the brakery station and fridge. In the middle was an island of clean anodized metal tables. The whole place was lit like a hospital operation room. Shiny pots, pans and plates reflected the diffuse lighting into everyones eyes.  <br>
        "She said if I'm late again she'll find another dish washer." <br>
        "Do you want another job? This could be your big break." <br>
        "I want another boss." <br>
        "Even after she made you that schedule? She laminated it. I saw it. All the different colours." <br>
