        </h3>

        This was my first proper rest day of the whole trip. Earlier in the week I read: 'Learn how to press pause before life presses it for you' on the spine of a book on a shelf. Whether I liked it or not, today was a rest day. A combination of jet lag, strange food and unfarmiliar language left me completely exhausted. And so, after a hearty lunch I napped for almost 5 hours (maybe?). For a lot of this time I was joined by a dopey Nala who you can see in some of these pictures/videos. It is remarkable that millions of years of gene iterations led to 'cuteness' through evolution (or through the kindness of a creator - or both). <br>
        I've been able to do a log a day (or catch up) for almost 2 weeks now. I'm not sure if I can keep up doing one a day for another 8 months, but I'll keep going for as long as I can. I'll set myself up for success if I remember that a log can be anything, nothing 'substantial' (since defining that is hard). I don't even need to do a log a day. It's not as if the value of the trip, or my self worth, is based off of how consistently I can do this thing. I'm enjoying practicing on my practice pad each day and writing notes in this funny notepad. Just one day at a time. After all: Loved Treasured Regardless. <br>
        I didn't manage to get a picture but I swam to a little reef today and saw a most magical crab. It was a wonderful view standing on the reef, the horizon line is so sharp. The transition between dark blue sea and greeny blue sky is SO quick, even this alone trumps all cinematography whats its. Anyways, he caught me by surprise, scuttling between pools. His body was about the size of a coaster and he shot by my foot, gave me a proper fright. I don't know how long I spent looking at him but I stayed still enough for him to get over his fear of seeing me and start eating. He used his 2 stunning blue pinsers to scoop rocks into his gob toddler style. His mouth was made of 2 pieces of shell which went laterally. It reminded me, of course, of all the crabs I've seen in nemo or other animated movies but it reminded me most of a transformer. His chomping was barely organic, it looked mechanical, like hydraulics. If he was skyscraper size it'd definitely make a chunky metal sound. Like big gears in clocks or... like transformers really. It'd be pretty terrifying. I picked a rock about his size and dipped it into the water. Instantly, I could tell his heart started racing. He posed up, stretching his pinsers as wide as they could go (he was now maybe 20cm long). When I moved the rock around the little pool, he mirrored it. Maybe it was cruel, but for about 3 minutes I just made him dance. By moving the rock side to side proper quick, it for real looked like the crab rave video. He had 2 limbs coming out of his back. Not legs, but not arms either. They helped him navigate around the sharp edges of the pool like bumpers on bumper cars and are probably made him more threatening from behind. Our meeting finished with me trying to tap his exoskeleton with the rock. I got within 2cm before he let out an almighty attack. Bringing his pincers together, he pinched the rock, I felt the vibrations all the way up my arm. It was lightning fast and frightened me so much I dropped the rock. I didn't have the courage to reach in and pick it back out so I said goodbye.
