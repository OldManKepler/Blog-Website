        CONTINUATION FROM LAST ENTRY <br>
        "You see, my maturity horseshow is still a pretty new idea. But I've began reseaching behaviour in some control groups to identify the nature of those at different points of the scale. Way on the left, on the mature side we have very measured people. The people in the control groups I've seen are often uneffected by issues presented to them. When faced with obstacles, they know methods of overcoming the issues and rarely come away scathed. Interestingly, here's what I've found on the otherside of the spectrum: The behaviour of the radically immature is somewhat similar. For example, in one of the tests we ran, we asked 20 children to sit and wait outside a trampoline park, under the premise that is was full. They didn't know of course, but they were being monitored in that moment. For almost all children, they became restless and started to fidget but when being sent home with bad news (there was no trampoline park and they just wasted an hour of their lives in an office lobby) many of them got up and merrily went on their way. Unscathed. There was only one or two instances where a child burst into tears and these was quickly remedied by a lollipop." <br>
        "How about the nature of those in the middle of the scale?" <br>
        "Good question. Interestingly, these people were the least functioning. Often, they would present well but when looking at the paper questionaire they filled out after the test, I found that they suffered. When faced with small challenges, overcoming these were always difficult, some would shut down and some would react violently. Also, in the 1 on 1 sessions, this group's popular topics were 'insecurities', 'overthinking' and 'world vs me'. These people often were 'making mountains out of molehills' so to speak - blowing things out of preportion, you know. They seemed terribly antisocial as well, always made it all about themselves." <br>
        Dr Whitaker had walked out beyond the podium and to the base of the tan cushion seats. Behind him, a faint line of smoke began to rise out of the vent of the projector. 
        "Ok, If you have questions, I'll take them now." Various students around the room put up their hands. <br>
        "How did you measure 'maturity'? What scale did you use? It seems like quite a vague activity." <br>
        "Well I assure you, it was quite a complicated activity." <br>
        "In all your efforts to 'diagnose' other's and their maturity levels. Did you identify your own? What level are you?" <br>
        In that moment the projector let out it's final breath. A giant screech sound split the room in two, from the top of the projector burst black smoke and a bush of flames. The tounges of fire repidly began advancing down the podium. <br>
        "Bollocks!" Dr Whitaker rushed to his bag and folded his laptop under his arm. "Does this always happen?" <br>
        "Of course not!" Someone from the audience responded. <br>
        "Then why do these problems always happen only to me!" <br>
        All was thrown into chaos as the fire alarm sounded. Students rushed out of the hall like the water spraying from the ancient cieling sprinklers, acting as the last stand. The final lecture in the lecture hall of Tacaruna Community College was by most accounts, a disaster. But, if we were to look at this circumstance in a in a measured, reasonable light, we find out that this was quite a remarkable day: for a group of, now wiser, behavioral psychology students; And, most notably, for the Tacaruna Community College administration team which claimed insurance compensation, totalling to 450,000 dollars.
