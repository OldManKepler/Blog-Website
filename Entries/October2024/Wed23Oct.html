        "Hello everbody." <br>
        It had been many months since the Tacaruna community college alumni had heard a new voice inside the lecture hall. Despite having only 7 hours of contact time a week, lectures were rarely populated. As a result, the lecture hall scarcely used. If you had the privellege to be enrolled in the 'behavioral psychology' degree of Tacaruna community college, chances are your hours would be spent in an air conditioned, brightly lit, freshly painted and well smelling classroom in the northern block. Despite yellowing with age, the walls of the lecture hall had seen a lot. Had the buzzing lights been fitted with ears, they would be littered with degrees. And if the rotting floorboards not the home for a colony of woodlice, the college wouldn't need to spend tens of thousands knocking down this building. Nevertheless, the students were glad to be in the lecture hall for one final time. And so, the audience mumbled their reply. <br>
        "How is everybody doing. Good. Well I'm delighted to have the opportunity be giving this lecture to you all, and in this wonderful building. Of course. Um, as you may know I'm doctor Aiden Whitaker and I specialise in behavioural psychology. I researched the idea of 'matureness' and would like to share with you what, over many years, I have found. I call this the 'maturity horseshoe'." <br>
        Dr Whitaker reached down and clicked a button on the projector. <br>
        "As that spins to life I'll tell you a bit about it. We are all familiar with the political spectrum right? A line where we plot along the axis going from far left ideals to far right. Some people would argue that a more accurate representation of this spectrum would be if it were horseshoe shaped. This way the far left and far right bend close to each other in the centre. Some would believe that this is more accurate since the behaviour exibited by those with extreme ideals are quite similar. Think Stalin and Putin. This is what I intend to get at with my 'maturity horseshoe'. Bloody..." <br>
        By this point the projector had begun singing a sorry song. It's piercing hum and periodic crackling noises spoke of years of neglect. Making his ball into a fist, Dr Whitaker hammered down one swift blow onto the projector casing. As if by magic, the whining stopped, and now a fan noise was audible. <br>
        "Wonderful. Right. Ok so... at one side of my horse shoe is absolute maturity, and at the other side is absolute naivety. Maturity here we will describe as: Deep, reasonable thinking and decision making, especially when there is a developed understanding about how things make you feel and how you effect others. On the other hand, naivety we could describe as the oppsite of this: often shallow thinking and decision making, based off of wims, wants and desires. In many cultures we know the elderly as mature, since for them a lifetime has been spent developing an understanding of themselves and how they effect others. Alternately, children are often considered immature. They chose to do things because they like to, despite how much it might injure them for example." <br>
        Whilst Dr Whitaker was speaking, the projector had begun illuminating the back wall. He turned to look at what was being displayed only to find a faint blue-upsidedown-trapesium shaped error message. Dr Whitaker reached down and picked the thing up. Lifting it to his face, he closed one eye to look into the lens. Of course, this had no effect, except from to make some students laugh at his now bright-blue glowing face. <br>
        "Hell." <br>
        He fiercely put it back down, causing the image to be lost completely and all to go silent. The suspense was broken a few moments later by the projector fan slowly spinning up again. Dr Whitaker shot a glance up at the students before reaching down into his bag and pulling out a long black cable. Vigirously, he gutted the projector and replaced the cable. <br>
        "Let's give that a go shall we." He laughed dryly, passing a grey hankerchief over his scalp. <br>
