        "Have some more." <br>
        "Really, I'm full. I don't need any more." <br>
        "There's no need to be polite. Just say when." <br>
        "When." <br>
        "Stop being silly I haven't switched any on yet." <br>
        Standing over the table, she reached a wrinkled hand down and picked up one of the objects arranged in the blue and yellow ceramic fruit bowl. She lifted it into her open palm. It was grey and lightly freckled, quite round, like a pebble, and robust looking. The only thing which stopped it looking like a rock was a thin matte sheen covering the whole surface. It scattered the room lights in such a way you could tell it was man made, like it was almost very slightly fluffy.

        "Just a little bit more, it's good for you, you know. You'll like this one." <br>
        Gently, she took her index finger and layed it on top of the pebble. It hummed, giving off an electric blue glow. As if casting a spell, she swiped her finger, pointing right at my forehead. Suddenly, I felt my arms go limp, my glass crashed onto the floor. My head rocked back against the chair and my mouth plopped open. I couldn't move a muscle. All I could see now was the dinner table scene fading into a watery blur. To my left was my Julia, to the right sat her father, and opposite stood her mother.<br>
        "You know Julia, ever since Robert introduced me to these new pebble things I've been feeling so much younger. We just can't learn things like we used to. On the telecomertial their salogan was 'Food for thought, why not thought for food?' Is that right Robert? How awesome! Just switch it on and within a few minutes you'd have learn't a new skill. This one was... let me see...'Hawaiian Cooking'. I hope you enjoyed your Loco Moco."
