        This log marks a month(ish) of logs which I have completed. This last week it's been pretty hard to keep up with them but I think they're all up to speed. I've been thinking about my process of learning things. I think that when faced with an obvious example of new thing -> new outcome it's pretty easy to adopt. For example it is easy to understand how spending time learning the notes of the fretboard on guitar will translate to more fun playing. It's a lot harder to learn (or unlearn) the habits which don't have such a clear cut outcome. I find myself binging loads of youtube sometimes which is such a dead thing cause it feels so seperate from reality. Like when whatching loads of Youtube videos in a row the universe seases to exist, I occupy a state of inactive consumption. Realising the universe exists is far cooler. I know this now because I'm writing this on Saturday. Youtube can be a good thing and youtube videos can be very well made (as I've found out) but I need to consume the by choice, not by habit. But about the process, maybe I just need to go enough through these cycles until I level up and start worrying about the next thing. Like if I can get sick at going to bed without distractions I'll have time to worry about excersize or diet. Maybe I can do them all at the same time, I think I'd find that exhausting. My youtube binge sessions usually come when I feel most tired, most discouraged. There's always a moment of 'see you were right' as if my incompetency is proof that I am not infact loved and treasured regardless. In that moment, all self confidence or nice kind things kinda feel naive. Bouncing back is always good but you can't help but think 'If I feel like I'm right now, can't I be as equally right then?' - Could I be equally as unworthy of love as I feel as I am worthy of love right now? I think the answer is complicated. I wrote some more but I decided to delete it. This is somehow linked to 'meaning' and all that other complicated stuff. In House MD, House always goes on about how Wilson tries to create meaning by helping people. House is a narcisist who has problems, but having such a morbid philosphy comes across as almost wise. He gives the vibe of 'Humans are a collection of atoms doing what they can to get by - and thats pathetic'. I think its more worth concluding something like 'Humans are a super complex collection of atoms and emotions which all make their own decisions which affect themselves and you in different ways - thats pretty cool'. I think it's harder to believe option 2 than option 1. I'm going to write 'loved treasured regardless' even though our relationship is a bit complicated. loved treasured regardless
