        My review of the movies 'The Platform' and 'The Platform 2' (as a package deal). <br>
        Platform 1<br>
        I don't know very much about the writers or directors of these films but I know how they made me feel. Annoyed. To begin with, 'The Platform 1' is a magical experience. The greatest privellege in film watching is being transported. Writers, actors, directors, costume designers, producers, cinematographers, composers and more are all responsible for creating a world. If the world were a building, Platform 1 (the film) would be the pentagon. Incredibly sturdy, remarkably grounded and richly deep - impenetrable. I'd say that for me, the main aspects which contribute to a great world are the dialogue, cinematography and plot. Let's explore these together. <br>
        The dialogue in The Platform is incredible. Primarily, what makes it insteresting is the fact that it's in Spanish. Already, this helps craft a world since a non-spanish speaker is unlikely to have been soaked in the culture which this language is a part of. We can assume that the characters have habits and priorities different to our own, deepening the world in which they live. Would Lord of the Rings be as fleshed out without those fictional languages? Or Star Trek without Vulcan? Or even Starwars without funny noises? Secondly, the dialogue is filled with nuances which make it so snappy. For example, when introducing the character of the old man, he repeatedly uses the word 'obviously'. As the movie goes on, we can see that the old man effects the main character. The writers call back to this when we see the main character responding with this same token word. Finally, the sparseness of the dialogue creates lots of space. This invites the audience to learn about the characters and the world they live in by how it looks, how it changes and how it makes other people feel. This is a testiment not only to the dialogue, but the cinematography aswell. <br>
        I've just thought that I don't actually know if what I mean is 'cinematography'. I can tell you that I'm impacted by what I see on screen, but more specifically the set, lighting, outfit choises, editing of the movie and choice of shot? Anyways, a story trope which has always gripped me is the 'stuck in a room with another person' trope (especially if it's sci fi). The other movies I can remember which have this trope are this B movie on prime called 'infinity chamber', '2001 space oddesy' (kinda), and some more but I can't remember. This trope has to focus heavily on dialogue since shooting locations don't really change. However, I think that The Platform does an amazing job at making use of what it can. The platforms themselves are big enough to feel isolating but small enough to feel claustrophobic. They wonderfully contrast the kitchen scenes, which are some of my favourite of the movie. I'm slightly losing focus whilst writing this so I'm gonna wrap it up here. It's really good. And the plot is really good. <br>
        I'd watch it again. You should watch it. 8/10
