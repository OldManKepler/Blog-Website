        My review of 'The Time Machine' by H.G.Wells <br>
        As far as I know, this is one of the first Sci-Fi novels ever written. H.G.Wells, also known for 'War of the Worlds', writes a compelling 100 page short story about a charismatic time traveller and his adventures aboard his creation. In a thorough, logical and creative way, H.G.Wells builds a world around this new idea, exploring the theoretical physics and opportunities enabled by the machine. The story is delivered by the time traveller himself but filtered through the narrators eyes. Whereas other characters become animated through effective dialogue and description, we, as the reader, know very little about the narrator. This allows us to imprint the narrator onto ourselves, as if we are reading a journal entry we wrote a few days prior and trying to remind ourselves of the strange circumstances. Through this, H.G.Wells' ambitious ideas and obscure descriptions of a future world become almost entirely believable. In this sense, it makes it world's best introduction to Sci-Fi. Especially since the narrator recounts the event of his time traveller friend, early readers in the 19th centurary could remain completely glued, despite the giant cazm of difference between horse drawn carriages and a machine which moves through time. <br>
        H.G.Wells displays vast knowledge in various subjects throughout the book. The time traveller is clearly intellectual and infuses his recount of events with facts about stellar patterns, moon phases, rocks, anthropology, paleantology and even bottany. Despite the story being fictitious, the discoveries of the traveller seem to be built on verifiable science and facts (especially the ending sequence of the time travel). Therefore, the book is infused with a quasi-realism which strengthens the legitimacy of the world - it feels grounded. Moreover, it just feels as if Wells has poured himself enthusiastically into the novel. Almost as if he is the traveller himself, eager to share his ideas. Imagine what a world he would've created with 200 or even 300 pages of this same story.<br>
        To our modern minds, this novel may seem primitive, especially in it's depiction of the futuristic world. For me, this was the area which felt the weakest. But of course it would! In the 1800s engines were just being made (I think). So when the book mentions 'machines' and refuses to elaborate, we can understand that for the average 19th centurary man the 'big machines' are sufficient to satisfy curiosity. Whereas Sci-Fi novels today have the scope of the last 100 years to imagine the possible trajectory of technology, H.G.Wells would have probably comatosed had he seen the iphone. Nevertheless, I'd argue that these quirks shift the focus from possile technologies and awesome worlds, to the nature of the futuristic humans and their social landscapes. Therefore, Wells explores this (maybe 4th dimentional) aspect of story telling and comments on how it reflects the 1890s. This is a powerful way to utilize a different perspective, a 802,701 years new perspective. <br>
        Really enjoyed it. Great for, I'd say... 2 weeks? 1 week if you're on holiday.
